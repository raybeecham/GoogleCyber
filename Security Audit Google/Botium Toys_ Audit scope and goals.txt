Botium Toys: Audit scope and goals 
  



Summary: Perform an audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit needs to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices. The audit is meant to provide mitigation recommendations for vulnerabilities found that are classified as “high risk,” and present an overall strategy for improving the security posture of the organization. The audit team needs to document their findings, provide remediation plans and efforts, and communicate with stakeholders.
  

Scope: (To understand the audit scope, review the security audit reading. Note that the scope is not constant from audit to audit. However, once the scope of the audit is clearly defined, only items within scope should be audited. In this scenario, the scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures).
Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:
* Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event management (SIEM) tool.
* Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
* Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting, end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
* Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place align with necessary compliance requirements.
* Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.
  
  
Goals: (The goal of an audit is the desired deliverables or outcomes. The goal of an audit can be to achieve compliance, to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities within an organization, and/or to understand failures in processes and procedures and correct them. In this scenario, the IT manager set the goals. He is expecting a report of the current security posture of the organization and recommendations for improving the security posture of the organization, as well as justification to hire additional cybersecurity personnel.)
The goals for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are:
* To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) 
* Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant 
* Fortify system controls
* Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential management 
* Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
